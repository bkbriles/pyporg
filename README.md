# pyporg

My picture folder is out of control. It's a mess. The goal here is to scrape meta data and organize things into new folders by month and year. I'm using python because I hear awesome things about it and want to learn. The os module looks pretty sexy too.

As of now, it's working alright for me in Linux, but I haven't tested in any other environment. I'd like to get a working GUI in place before doing that.
